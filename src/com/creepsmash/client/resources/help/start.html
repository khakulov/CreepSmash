<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>CreepSmash is a game for 2-4 Players, who can play on one map. 
At the beginning of the game each player has 20 lives, 200 credits to start 
and 200 credits income per round (one round lasts 15 seconds).
The income increases when the player sends creeps to the next player. 
If the creep walks through the whole map of the opponent, 
he/she loses a live. If there are more than two players, the creep walks to the 
next player's map, otherwise the creep starts again at the
opponent's map. <br />
So it is likely a good idea to increase the income by sending creeps. 
To avoid the loss of own lives it is also recommended to build towers 
on the own map. Of course the towers should be placed at a good point 
to reach as many creeps as possible.<br />
There are many different kinds of towers and creeps. 
You have to discover which strategy you choose to win a match.<br /><br /><br />Have Fun!</p>
