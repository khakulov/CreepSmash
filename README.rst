CreepSmash is a online multiplayer towerdefense game.
=====================================================

The game is for 2-4 Players, who can play on one map. At the beginning of the game each player has 20 lives, 200 credits to start and 200 credits income per round (one round lasts 15 seconds). The income increases when the player sends creeps to the next player. If the creep walks through the whole map of the opponent, he/she loses a live. If there are more than two players, the creep walks to the next player’s map, otherwise the creep starts again at the opponent’s map.

So it is likely a good idea to increase the income by sending creeps. To avoid the loss of own lives it is also recommended to build towers on the own map. Of course the towers should be placed at a good point to reach as many creeps as possible.
